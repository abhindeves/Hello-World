1. **Predictive Financial Model**: The goal is to create a predictive financial model using probability models, specifically Bayes Theorem and Markov Chains, to forecast financial market movements. This model would consider not only the current state but also previous states, similar to a Hidden Markov Model. This approach could potentially offer a systematic, data-driven trading method, minimizing human bias and emotion.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**: There's potential in sentiment analysis to reveal hidden market influencers, providing a trading advantage. The sentiment already calculated in the MMI could be used to update the existing probability model.

3. **Co-integration**: The use of co-integration to identify the most correlated stocks could potentially enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of stock selection.

4. **AI in Project Management**: The potential use of AI agents in project management could potentially improve project efficiency and effectiveness.

5. **Investment Strategies**: The participants discussed Warren Buffett's investment strategy, clarifying that it may not be suitable for their trading model as Buffett is an investor, not a trader.

## The Story

The idea originated from a professor who was impressed with their work. The initial **Hypothesis** was that Bank Nifty would go up, given that Nifty already went up. They realized that Bank Nifty or Nifty as an index is a collective of multiple stocks, based on probabilities of individual stocks. They decided to eliminate the noise from all those probabilities and look at one particular stock and how it moves. They plan to find the Market Mood Index (MMI) for a particular stock. They want to understand how well correlated the stock is with the mood of the market. They plan to find out which stock is the most correlated and pick up that stock to do an options index. They want to explore the technical aspect of a Markov Chain.

They mentioned the **Medallion Fund**, which is a closely guarded secret. They believe that a professor they know is somehow a part of it. They need to conduct extensive research and need time for it. They mentioned AI agents, which is a system with three or four agents. These models can interact with each other, and one model's output is given to another model.

They plan to find the Market Mood Index (MMI) for a particular stock. They believe that if both of them can contribute to this together, the probability of cracking this would be much higher. They emphasize the need for regular homework and meetings. They are thinking about the project in probabilistic terms.

They want to understand how well correlated the stock is with the mood of the market. They plan to find out which stock is the most correlated and pick up that stock to do an options index. They want to explore the technical aspect of a Markov Chain. **Their end objective is to create something that would give them revenue, much more than what they're getting paid for right now.**

## Action Items

- Continue studying Bayes Theorem and Markov Chain and explore their applications further.
- Develop a predictive model using these concepts and test it on real-world data.
- Collaborate with others to refine the model and explore new ideas.
- Explore other potential predictors that could be used in the model, such as sentiment and the Market Mood Index.
- Scrape publicly available data to test these predictors.
- Consider moving into options trading and algorithmic trading.
- Explore the technical aspect of a Markov Chain.
- Conduct extensive research and allocate time for it.
- Consider the possibility of creating a firm.

## Future Steps

1. The entrepreneurs plan to continue studying Bayes Theorem and Markov Chain and explore their applications further.
2. They intend to develop a predictive model using these concepts and test it on real-world data.
3. They plan to collaborate with their professor and others to refine their model and explore new ideas.
4. They are interested in exploring other potential predictors that could be used in their model, such as sentiment and the Market Mood Index. They plan to scrape publicly available data to test these predictors.
5. They are considering moving into options trading and algorithmic trading, and they plan to apply the concepts they're studying to these fields. They have already seen promising results from their initial forays into these areas.
